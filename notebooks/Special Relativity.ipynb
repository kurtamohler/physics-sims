    "\n",
    "Einstein of course knew about Galilean relativity. He also knew about Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, which were much newer than Galilean relativity. I won't go into the details, but one of the striking consequences of Maxwell's equations is that they seemed to be saying that a ray of light always travels at the same speed in all inertial frames of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result directly contradicts Galilean relativity, which has the consequence that all objects will have a different velocity in different frames of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Einstein saw this contradiction and thought that the premises of Galilean relativity needed to be modified. Remember from the notes on Galilean relativity that there were two premises: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames and the time coordinate is universal. Einstein decided to throw out the universal time premise and replace it with the constant speed of light premise. So the two main premises of his new relativity theory were:\n",

    "* The speed of a ray of light is always the same for all inertial observers.\n",

    "Einstein thought about what the consequences of these two postulates were, and he found that they end up giving different equations for reference frame transformation than those given by Galilean relativity. He also found that he could make testable predictions that differed from pre-existing theories of physics, and those predictions turned out to be correct.\n",

    "In order to derive the special relativity transformation, we'll need to construct a thought experiment that demonstrates some of the properties of the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to make sure the experiment involves both of the postulates. That means that we'll need to do something that involves a light ray, so that we can make use of the constant speed of light postulate. We'll also need to look at the scenario from two or more frames of reference and compare what happens in them, in order to make use of the postulate that the laws of motion are the same in all frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we threw out the universal time posutulate from Galilean relativity, the amount of time between two events could potentially be different if we measure it in two different frames. So it would make sense to construct a scenario that uses a clock to measure the time between the events. We'll can create a kind of clock using a laser beam and a mirror.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll stand still holding a laser some known distance $r$ away from a stationary mirror. At time $t=0$, I'll pulse the laser by quickly turning it on and off again. After some period of time the laser pulse will hit the mirror and get reflected. After another period of time, the laser pulse will arrive back at my position. Since we know the distance that the pulse travels and its speed, we can calculate the round trip time. In this sense we've created a clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could (but won't) set up a detector at the tip of the laser so that it sends out a new pulse each time the previous pulse comes back. That would create an actual clock signal with a fixed known frequency. But in this experiment, we'll only need to look at the time period of one pulse.\n",
